This repository implements a Speech Recognition system that converts spoken language into text using machine learning models. It supports real-time recognition via a microphone and processes audio files in formats like WAV and MP3. The project leverages libraries like `speech_recognition`, `pyaudio`, and deep learning frameworks such as `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`. It is customizable for specific use cases, allowing for model training or fine-tuning. To use, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the provided examples for microphone or audio file input. Contributions are welcome! For detailed usage, check the documentation.
